## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!

In my 1st and 2nd years, I developed a solid foundation in ECE fundamentals such as signals and systems, antennas, electromagnetic waves, communication theory, and VLSI design, along with embedded systems and hardware-level programming.
Now, in my 3rd and 4th years, Iâ€™m integrating that strong ECE core with AI & ML technologies to build intelligent, data-driven, and connected systems. Iâ€™m also expanding into frontend and full-stack development to create complete end-to-end applications that bring my ideas to life.

ðŸ’¡ Interests:
Electronics â€¢ Embedded Systems â€¢ Signals & Communication â€¢ Antennas & EM Waves â€¢ VLSI â€¢ Artificial Intelligence â€¢ Machine Learning â€¢ Deep Learning â€¢ Computer Vision â€¢ Full-Stack & Frontend Development
